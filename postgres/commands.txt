postgres EIA dump:

pg_dump -U postgres -h localhost -p 5432 -d eia --no-owner | gzip -9 > init.sql.gz

from inside docker container, might have to docker cp 
pg_dump -U postgres -h localhost -p 5432 -d demo --no-owner | gzip -9 > init.sql.gz
pg_dump -U postgres -h localhost -p 5433 -d demo --no-owner | gzip -9 > init.sql.gz

needed "no-owner" to avoid permission issue, -O flag didn't work. then I needed to change
the user specified in the dockerfile, docker-compose file and ormconfig file to be postgres
(what if I had wanted the user to be something else? could I have specified this in the pg_dump)

then I needed to make sure that I connedcted to the database specified in the dockerfile, 
docker-compose file and ormconfig file.

the ormconfig files need to match so that the server app can connect to the database as well.

gzcat < init.sql.gz | head -n 20
