utility to create typeorm entities from preexisting tables

TODO:
right now the database returns all data for each series when user searches. 
each series and full data is stored in Redux store under 'series'. Should 
search only return metadata to populate the datacards, then we make a second 
database request to get the series data for Dataset Details?

searching 'description' column is not enough to find relevant series.

database queries are too slow--how to speed up?
