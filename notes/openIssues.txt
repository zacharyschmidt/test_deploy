in DatasetDetails I need a reliable way to make sure the series has correct order
must account for different timesteps
 
refactor fetchdataaction (in eia/actions) so that the logic to create the query happens
outside of the action creator. 

make it so that search results remain in the store and reload after I navigate back to main
page. then add button to clear search results?(low priority)

RIS download button doesn't work--button component should accept render props to 
display either 'download csv' or 'download RIS' and then the function to perform 
correct action.

filters don't work right now--build these. Do I need to add any columns to the database?

pagination

full text search

add indexes for speed


right now we are sending meta data and data when search is used (to populate results), 
and then we get same data again onclick for dataset details. should send only meta data 
on search


should selecting filters send a query (so that data appears)?
______________________________________________________
later: build ability to search and download Categories ('collections'?)
output format should be data container
should we call to eia api in order to get data (just hold metadate in database) (faster or space constriants to consider)
